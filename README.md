Use IBMâ€™s Data Science Experience (DSX) and IBM cloud services to create a working cloud-based application from start to finish.  Participants will be led through a series of three labs. The labs build upon one another so it is important that they are completed in order.

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - The first lab will begin with loading raw delimited data into DB2 Warehouse for Cloud and interacting with that data from a Jupyter notebook in DSX with python.

1. [Lab 2](Lab 2) - The second lab will guide participants in creating an R notebook and Shiny UI in DSX using RStudio.

1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - The third lab will show how to use the Watson Machine Learning capability to create a machine learning model based on the supply chain data set. The machine learning model, deployed in the IBM Cloud, will be used to predict the severity level of each discrepancy based on action request characteristics. 


## Instructions:

### Step 1. Sign up for the IBM Data Science Experience (DSX).   We recommend using the Firefox browser.

__NOTE__: If you already have a DSX account, please skip to __Step 2__.

#### Create an account.

1.  Go to [http://datascience.ibm.com/](http://datascience.ibm.com/)

2.  Click the Sign Up button on the top right

### Step 2. Create a project

1. Click on Projects > View All Projects to see a list of your projects. You should only see a default project.

2. Click on the New project icon on the top right of the project list.

3. Type a name for your project. For instance, "DSX Lab". A Spark service and an object storage will be automatically selected as well as a container with a default name. A container is a directory on the object storage. Click on Create.
